BBC remake for 100devs class 8 - Restarted because I got stuck at the one I was at at that moment. Just trying to restart

I finished it and I will say, I did the right thing by restarting. It went WAY quicker than the first one, and I am happy with the result! Having to think of a new solution really helped and I can safely say I am happy with how this turned out!
